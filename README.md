# Clapping Music

Apparently it only takes around 90 characters of Ruby code to play Steve Reich's minimalist classic ["Clapping Music"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapping_Music) on a Mac. Minimalist music, minimalist code.

Right before giving a talk at Ruby Conf 2016 I saw Celeen Rusk's ["Rhythmic Recursion"](https://youtu.be/cSPhgRgjwZs). Seeing as my talk included a section on code golf, it seemed fitting to combine our two subjects into one almost readable line of code.

Special thanks to the `say` command and Ruby's ability to have Unicode characters in identifiers.
